# Leaderboard Fix Summary

## Problem Fixed ✅
**Error**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON`

## Root Cause
The Leaderboard component was trying to fetch data from `/api/leaderboard`, but since the frontend runs on port 5173 and the backend on port 3001, the request was going to the wrong server and receiving HTML (404 page) instead of JSON.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed API URL
**Before:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/leaderboard');
```

**After:**
```typescript
const SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:3001';
const response = await fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/api/leaderboard`);
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added proper HTTP status code checking
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Added retry functionality when API calls fail
- Added loading states and error UI feedback

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Loading spinner while fetching data
- Error message with retry button when request fails
- Graceful handling of empty leaderboard
- Clear display of player rankings and statistics

## Technical Details
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express serving JSON API on port 3001
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/leaderboard` returns array of player statistics
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic state reset and manual retry option

## Testing
The leaderboard now successfully:
1. ✅ Fetches data from correct backend URL
2. ✅ Displays player rankings with win rates
3. ✅ Shows appropriate loading states
4. ✅ Handles network errors gracefully
5. ✅ Allows retry on failure

## Sample API Response
```json
[
  {
    "playerId": "23285b5a-7bbb-43a4-84f2-62622f64b71c",
    "username": "ritesh",
    "gamesWon": 0,
    "gamesLost": 1,
    "totalGames": 1,
    "winRatio": 0
  }
]
```

The leaderboard feature is now fully functional and can be accessed by clicking the "Leaderboard" button in the game interface.
